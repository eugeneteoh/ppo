# Proximal Policy Optimization

Implementation of [Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm. This implementation uses PyTorch and Gym. Some implementation details from this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12729.pdf) are also added.

## Usage

To install package and run PPO:

```bash
pip install .   # Installs package
run_ppo         # Run PPO
```
